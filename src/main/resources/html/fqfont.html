<p style="font-size: xx-large; font-weight: bold; text-align: center; text-indent: 0">7 Types of Failure </p>
<p style="font-size: xx-large; font-weight: bold; text-align: center; text-indent: 0">and How to Handle Them</p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span class="first-chapter-phrase"><span class="first-in-chapter character-w">W</span>hen I was 18, I came</span> up with an idea to launch a clothing brand with my then best friend. We designed a logo, manufactured our first t-shirts, and talked about our exciting plans for the future of the brand. However, when the moment arrived to register the company and obtain funding, my soon-to-be formal business partner showed that he wasn’t as serious about the idea as I had hoped. I had to pressure him into meetings with potential people who could lend us money. I quickly realized that it would be better to take my losses and terminate the idea before we launched a business that would be destined to fail — along with ending our friendship.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">In hindsight, it was a surprisingly wise decision, considering I was only 18 and had little business experience. It stung to watch my dream of owning a clothing company die before it was even born, but it was a necessary milestone in my business life.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">This story is but one example of failure I experienced in my life. Failure comes in many flavors, and I tasted them all. In this part, each chapter will cover a common type of failure, provide some examples and address how to handle it in the most effective way.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Please note that a failure can belong to multiple categories, so sometimes you’ll need to mix two approaches to handle your specific situation. Even if you don’t feel that a certain type of failure applies to you, I suggest that you read this chapter in its entirety, so you can understand how people set themselves up for a failure, process it in an unconstructive way, and/or how they can prevent it from happening again.</p>
